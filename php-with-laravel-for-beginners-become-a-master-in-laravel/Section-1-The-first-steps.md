# The First Steps

**Laravel** is framework that uses MVC architecture. I experience nodejs, They have similarities because nodejs also is a MVC framework but it uses JavaScript Language.

**MVC**

**Model** - Deals with databases.

**View** -  Deals with the front end. You can also use other front-end frameworks as your templating or view.

**Controller** - it is where the magic happens. Mostly, all the logical codes is stored in the controller section.
