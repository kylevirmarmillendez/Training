# Git and Github Version Control

**Git Installation**
[git](https://git-scm.com/)


**Git Commands**
- learning basic git commands such as git add, git commit, git status, git log and git checkout.

**git add** is a command that tracks the changes in the stagin are before commiting.

**git commit** use to save you changes.

**git log** will show all commits with its branch.

**git status** it shows the changes that are not added to the stanging area.

**git checkout** is use to have switch to a different branch and also with different commits. 


**Git Branching** - For me git branching is way to contribute to the project that will not affect the main branch unless it will be merged.

**git branch "branch name"** - is the command if you want to create another branch.

**git clone** - is the command that will clone a repository to your directory in your local PC.

**Fork** -is where you duplicate a reposity from other github account.
