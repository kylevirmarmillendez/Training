In the tutorial, Edwin Diaz uses godaddy for hosting but know godaddy is not free.


**GoDaddy** - Is web application hosting platform that also provides you domain name for your website.

But right now there are a lot of Free hosting sites like Netlify.

For beginners or those developers who wants to create a blog websites. I will recommend netlify because it is beginner friendly and it provides free hosting without domain name.
