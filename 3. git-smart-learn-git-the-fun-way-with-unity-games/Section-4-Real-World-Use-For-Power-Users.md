# Real World Use For Power 

**Github Structure** 

- Person XOR Organisation
    - Repository
       - Branch
       - Contributor


**Cloning Remotes**

***Clone or Download*** - You can clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer to make it easier to  add or remove files, and push larger commits. 

***Force Push*** should only be applied sparingly and in specific circumstances, like fixing a  branch or undoing errors. It's preferable to collaborate and evaluate changes using Git's regular workflows rather than forcing people to submit changes while working in groups.

***Market Place*** provides you extensions and add ons.

***Explore*** lets you explore on your repository.


***Git Large File Storage (LFS)*** is an extension that helps you to replaces large files in your Git repositories.
