# Common Use Cases

**Stashing** - allows you to locally store your most recent changes in a different location for later retrieval. It takes a snapshot of your local files and then resets your workspace's state back to the commit state.


**Branching** - Where Developers can work on distinct additions or modifications to a project on a branch, which is a separate line of development that keeps the main codebase unaffected. After the changes are finished, each branch can be merged back into the main branch, but it also maintains its own history, commits, and changes.


**Merge Conflicts** - Conflicting updates to the same line in a file or file deletions by two different people might result in merge conflicts.


**Reverting** - When a commit is rolled back, a new commit is made that reverses the modifications made by the prior commit, thus rolling back the code.
